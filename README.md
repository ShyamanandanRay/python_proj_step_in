# Project Information

* This is an All-in-One Unit and Currency convertor which consists top 30 country currencies, Weight conversion, Length Conversion, Temperature Conversion, and Area Conversion. 
* The Project consists a single .py file which can be run using a python IDE.
* The project has two external libraries "Requests" and "Tabulate".
* The requests library is the de facto standard for making HTTP requests in Python. It abstracts the complexities of making requests behind a beautiful, simple API so that you can focus on interacting with services and consuming data in your application.

* The "Tabulate" is Pretty-print tabular data in Python, a library and a command-line utility. 
  * The main use cases of the library are:  
    * printing small tables without hassle: just one function call, formatting is guided by the data itself
    * authoring tabular data for lightweight plain-text markup: multiple output formats suitable for further editing or transformation
    * readable presentation of mixed textual and numeric data: smart column alignment, configurable number formatting, alignment by a decimal point
